When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when multiple developers are working on the same project or when we need to make changes into files and roll back these changes without storing files from different location into local directory.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
when we are using git automatically the remote version might have changes that are inconsistent with your local version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks is used for copy on github to github repository not to local repository
clones is use to github to local repository to copy
branches  within a given project, allow for different paths of commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
without internet access we can get the most update remote branch with git fetch without  merging into the branch

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
using google derives, dropbox and some other file hosting sites or sending emails, copying files
